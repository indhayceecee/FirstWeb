    <p> MUSIC </p>
    <br>
Music travels all around my body
<br>Now I can say it's living right through me
<br>Listening to music puts me in a good mood
<br>It makes me want to stand up and start to groove
<<br>
<br>Music can make me forget all of my pain
<br>It brings out the sun when I can only see the rain
<br>I put on my headphones and play all of my songs
<br>I could listen to it all day long
<br>
<br>Music takes me to another place
<br>Higher than the sky and far away from the space
<br>There's nothing to compare to it in the whole world
<br>It wouldn't even be better than my favorite girl
<br>
<br>Music can teach you many lessons 
<br>Like stand up for your rights and all the good reasons
<br> I know there's people who thinks the same way
<br>Because they know music lives in us everyday</p></font>
